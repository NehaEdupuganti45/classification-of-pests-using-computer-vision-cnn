The classification of pests using computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves leveraging deep learning toidentify and categorize pest species from images. By training a CNN model on labeled pest image datasets, the algorithm learns torecognize distinct patterns, shapes, and features unique to each species. This approach enhances accuracy in pest detection,supporting agricultural monitoring and pest control strategies. Real-time pest classification using CNNs reduces reliance on manualidentification, improving efficiency and scalability in large-scale farming operations
